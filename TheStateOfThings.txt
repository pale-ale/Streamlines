###### What do we have?

An algorithm to create SLs:
- Greedy
- Sluggish  ( Complexity kn^2 (Timesteps * Iterations) * Timesteps , 10 * 25 * 10 = 2500 lines ~ 33 s)
- Pretty rough all around

A definition for time coherence
- Concept
- Data structures
- Implementation for heuristic measure

Some draft sections/structure for the thesis




###### How to fix things

For starters:
- Free schedule: Take 2 mo. leave, quit JPA2.2
=> Wed last day @ work, Thu last day JP

Finish time coherence:
- Gradient descent?
- Combine w/ proper seeding algorithm

Implement Verma's algorithm with feature guidance in 3D?
