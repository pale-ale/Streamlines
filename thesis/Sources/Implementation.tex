%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This chapter briefly mentions the used libraries, and focuses on the initial implementation of - and iterative additions to - the proposed algorithm.
\section{Libraries}
The algorithm is implemented in python3.10, and heavily relies on three libraries which are not part of the python3.10 standard library:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Paraview v.5.12.0: A Scientific visualization software, combining data science and interactive visualization while providing custom algorithm support via the VtkPythonAlgorithm base class.
    \item VTK v.9.3.20231030 : The library used to manage anything related with the data to be visualized in Paraview.
    \item Numpy v.1.23.4: Widespread data manipulation/scientific computing library, which is used to edit the data encapsulated by VTK's objects.
\end{itemize}
