\chapter{Method}
\label[section]{sec:method}
In this chapter, we describe the motivation and concepts used for developing
an algorithm supporting time coherence.
We start with an implementation we ultimately deemed infeasible in \Cref{sec:failedalg},
replacing it with the image-guided version described in \Cref{sec:basealg}.
\Cref{sec:tcmot} contains the motivation, i.e. why time coherence is beneficial,
and provide an example for undesirable effects that can appear without it.
The definition is provided in \Cref{sec:tcdef},
which we then adapt to our use case and implement in \Cref{sec:tcalg}.

\section{Motivation for Time Coherence}
\label[section]{sec:tcmot}
When visualizing a vector field using streamlines, it is desirable to capture the features of the field as accurately as possible.
For image-based solutions, this means that we are interested in a line placement that poses little to no visual distractions from the general field flow.
Common distractions include artifacts like shapes arising from the position of lines, but not being created by the actual field.
Other forms of visual clutter include strong variations in density, or empty spaces, which make it very hard to judge a field's behavior in these regions.
Usually, there is a trade-off between the accuracy of capturing a field and visual clarity,
with image-guided approaches favoring the latter.

A new type of visual artifact is introduced when we add a time axis to our data.
Where before, this approach could solely focus on optimizing a single image w.r.t. visual criteria, we now have to take into account the movement
of lines from one time step to another.

We can illustrate this behavior using the field in \Cref{fig:necessary1},
taking a closer look at $u(x,y,t)$ at two time steps $t=1$ and $t=3$.
The notable change of the field's trajectory from one time step to the next
is a strong ridge forming in the center column.

        (a) The streamline mostly drifting downward from time $t=1$ to $t=3$ (red).
        (b) The same initial streamline at $t=1$, but keeping same height at time $t=3$ (green) because the algorithm shifted the seed.
    }
    \label[figure]{fig:necessary2}
\end{figure}
We now show how this behavior can lead to a visual artifact when using streamlines as the means of visualization.
In \Cref{fig:necessary2} (a), we see how the increase in ridge height leads to movement of the whole streamline,
which is visually irritating as it distracts from the actual feature undergoing the change.
In fact, it suggests that instead of the center moving upward, the outer regions move downward,
giving room for misconception of the field's behavior.

What we are looking for is a line placement strategy that allows large portions of the image to 
stay the same between two time steps,
i.e. that achieves the largest possible ``streamline overlap'' between the two images, as shown
in the transition in \Cref{fig:necessary2} (b).
Here, large portions remain stationary, with only segments close to the center rising upwards,
reflecting the localized change much better.

An important factor for the generation of such images is the seed choice.
We have chosen the same centered seed in both cases in order to compare the
placement with and without our algorithm optimizing the seed position to respect
what we define in the next chapter as \textit{time coherence}.

% We have chosen to keep most of these actions as-is, the only difference introduced is
% a change to how the lengthening and shortening is done. 
% Instead of the two binary choices of lengthen/shorten and front/back, which only add/subtract a tiny bit at a time,
% we decided to choose a segment count at random between -5 and 5 for each end.
% This allows faster growth/shrinking (and hence faster convergence) while still preventing overlaps.

% \subsection{Initial Seeding}
% We prepare the image for the optimization routine by adding many streamlets with seeds on a regular grid to the image.
% This can also be done randomly yielding similar image quality,
% however strided access is more efficient with little to no benefit for the latter.

% \subsection{Oracle}
% The oracle from Turk and Bank's algorithm is used to suggest shorten/lengthen and move operations.
% Our oracle focuses on shorten/lengthen suggestions only.

% \subsection{Adding time coherence}
% We added two important modifications to the aforementioned algorithm to make it partially time-coherent.
% The first modification affects how seeds are chosen in the beginning of an optimization pass; the second affects
% how the energy measure is computed and lines are guided toward their final positions.
