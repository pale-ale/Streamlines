\section{Time Coherence - Definition}
\label[section]{sec:tcdef}
Based on the desired image overlap and concepts from computing the energy measure, we can infer a measure for time coherence.
We base this measure on the spatial energy function $E$ from the Turk and Banks algorithm.
\begin{leftbar}
    \textbf{Notation:} To avoid confusion, we from now on write the spatial components (former $E$ and $L$)
    as $E_s, L_s$ to better separate them from their temporal counterparts $E_t$ and $L_t$.
    $t$ has two further uses:
    If we talk about time steps, $t$ refers to the time, e.g., when describing vector fields $u(x,y,t)$.
    In the context of the Turk and Banks algorithm, $t$ is the target brightness.
\end{leftbar}

Instead of the comparison between a low-pass image of streamlines and a constant target brightness used in $E_s$,
the temporal energy $E_t$ now depends on two sets of streamlines ($I_0, I_1$) and uses a different low-pass filter ($L_t$):
\[E_t(I_0, I_1) = \int_x\int_y\left[(L_t\ast I_0)(x,y)-(L_t\ast I_1)(x,y)\right]^2\,\text{d}x\,\text{d}y\]
This measure tells us the sum of squared difference between the energy of two different sets of streamlines.
Allowing for a new kernel gives us more freedom to change \textit{how} we measure the temporal energy,
as we do not want it to behave the same way as the spatial energy does.
For example, the measure $E_s$ of two neighboring streamlines is the strongest in
the center of them, not at the actual streamline positions, which can be seen in \Cref{fig:closeenergy}.
This means that by using $E_s$ instead of $E_t$,
we would change the number or position of streamlines by drawing them into the center of two former streamlines,
thereby intently worsening time coherence.
Conversely, this would also prohibit streamline creation at darker spots, giving rise to holes in our streamline image.

The optimum for time coherence would of course be two identical sets of streamlines, which effectively minimize $E_t$ to zero.

% Combining it with the spatial measure $E$ via linear interpolation gives us a good amount of control how strong we want the coherence to be.

% Time Coherence refers to how a vector field behaves through different time steps.
% Intuitively, we consider areas within the field to be of high temporal coherence if the lines drawn on them are relatively stationary.
% Vice versa, we can say that an area of high fluctuation will be of low temporal coherence.
% A more formal definition employed in our algorithm is as follows:
% Given a field $F$ and a starting point $S_0$ (called the "seed"), we can integrate over the field.
% This yields a set of points $S^0$ which define a streamline containing every reached point, written as $S^0 = \int(S_0, F)$.
% We can therefore assign a streamline to every point in our field (and vice versa).
% Given $S_0$ and an unsteady field $F(t)$, compute for each time step $t_1...t_n$ the streamline $S^{0,t_i} = \int(S_0, F(t_i))$.
% In order to convert these sets of lines to a scalar, we use the Hausdorff Distance $dist(S^i,S^j)$,
% giving us the greatest minimal distance between any pair of two sets.
% We can therefore create a map $coh(S_i, F(t)): max(dist(\int(S_i, F(t_k)), \int(S_i, F(t_l))))$,
% sending each point in an unsteady vector field to a scalar, and thereby determining its temporal coherence.
