One of the most common elements used to represent vector fields are integral lines capable of showing flow dynamics, called streamlines.
Finding optimal placements and lengths of such lines with respect to time is a key component when trying to animate unsteady vector fields.
In this work, an algorithm capable of streamline placement with respect to time in an unsteady, continuous field will be presented.
Initially, an image-guided approach based on the work by Turk and Banks is used, which generates good streamline placements for a single constant-time vector field.
We then create a slightly different form of energy measure to dictate a previous time step's line placement, introducing a bias to the algorithm.
