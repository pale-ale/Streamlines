Vector field visualizations are used in many fields like aerospace engineering, fluid dynamics, or physics.
A common graphical representation of such fields are instantaneous integral lines, called streamlines.
The placement of such streamlines for a continuous and steady vector field is subject of contemporary research,
with a multitude of algorithms that can generate such streamline placements in an optimal way w.r.t different criteria.
This thesis's focus will be on the time-coherent placement of streamlines, i.e. minimizing streamline movement during changes of the underlying continuous, but unsteady vector field.
We present an iterative procedure that starts by seeding streamlines with a greedy algorithm for a single timestep.
The seeds are then optimized to make them time coherent for as many lines a possible.
The performance and complexity using different streamline seeding and modification strategies are examined and compared.
Finally some limitiations, possible imporovements, and ideas for future work will be listed.
